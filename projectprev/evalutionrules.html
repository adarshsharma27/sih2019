                PeopleSoft Benefits Administration processes all participant events by using the appropriate event rule or event classification rule for each covered plan type. Depending on the results of this evaluation, Benefits Administration either sets the participant event up for further processing or closes the event.

<strong> 1) evaluate events, the system runs through the following sequence for each plan type</strong> 

Benefits Administration uses the eligibility rules that you have defined to determine the participant's eligibility as of the effective date of the event.

For example, if a participant has moved from full-time to part-time status, he might be ineligible for current elections and would need to select from part-time plan options.</p>

2) <p>If the event causes the participant to lose eligibility for current elections, the event is prepared for further processing, regardless of how you defined your event rule.</p>

 3) At minimum, the system terminates the participant's newly ineligible elections.
 If the participant selects a new election within the plan type, the prior election is replaced as of the new election coverage and deduction begin dates.

<p>If the event rule has the Use History check box selected, the eligible options as of the event date are compared to the prior eligible options.</p>

If the participant has gained eligibility to new options, Benefits Administration prepares the event for further processing and enables new enrollment elections.

If the event rule does not have the Use History check box selected, the Select Allowed field controls further processing of the event. For example, for a family status change, plan type 10 (Medical), Select Allowed could be set to change the coverage code only. The options prepared by the system are only those within the same benefit plan as the current enrollment.

Loss of eligibility to a current election takes priority over event rule selection for both Use History and Select Allowed. The system's selection for Use History takes priority over Select Allowed.
                                                                                        </p>
